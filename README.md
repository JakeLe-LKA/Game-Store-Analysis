# Game Store Sales Analysis 

## Project overview

### Objective  
To analyze historical sales data from a game store and uncover insights regarding sales trends, product performance, regional behaviors, and marketing effectiveness to support better commercial and strategic decisions.

### Business context  
The store operates across several global regions with both online (website, mobile) and offline (in-store) sales channels. Understanding how sales vary over time and across regions, platforms, and marketing channels is essential for **allocating resources**, **planning seasonal promotions**, and **targeting customer segments more effectively**.

## Dataset structure

The analysis was based on an Excel file with two sheets:

### 1. `orders`

### 2. `region`
A reference sheet mapping country codes to broader regions (e.g., NA, EMEA, APAC)

### Marketing optimization
- Allocate more budget to **direct sales support and website UX improvements**.
