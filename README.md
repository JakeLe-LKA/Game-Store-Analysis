# Game Store Sales Analysis 

## Project overview

### Objective  
To analyze historical sales data from a game store and uncover insights regarding sales trends, product performance, regional behaviors, and marketing effectiveness to support better commercial and strategic decisions.

### Business context  
The store operates across several global regions with both online (website, mobile) and offline (in-store) sales channels. Understanding how sales vary over time and across regions, platforms, and marketing channels is essential for **allocating resources**, **planning seasonal promotions**, and **targeting customer segments more effectively**.

## Dataset structure

The analysis was based on an Excel file with two sheets:

### 1. `orders`

### 2. `region`
A reference sheet mapping country codes to broader regions (e.g., NA, EMEA, APAC)

## Recommendations

### Maximize seasonal revenue peaks
- **Capitalize on the strong revenue spikes in September and December** by launching targeted marketing campaigns and product bundles at least one month in advance.
- Introduce **limited-time holiday editions** or special promotions (e.g., ‚ÄúHoliday Gaming Bundle‚Äù) for best-selling products like Nintendo Switch and gaming monitors.
- Implement **inventory scaling and logistics preparedness** to avoid stockouts and delivery delays during high-demand periods.

---

### Optimize sales platforms
- Since the **website outperforms the mobile platform** in revenue, invest in:
  - Enhanced **website performance and user experience**.
  - Personalized product recommendations and simplified checkout flows.
- Consider **re-evaluating the mobile strategy**, or better integrate web-to-app experiences if mobile is to be retained.

---

### Double down on in-store channel strength
- **In-store selling remains the most effective marketing channel**, suggesting:
  - Expansion of physical sales promotions and exclusive in-store offers.
  - Use in-store data to segment and re-target online customers with personalized ads.
  - Increase **click-and-collect** functionality to bridge online and offline experience.

---

### Regional scaling strategy
- **North America leads in both revenue and order volume**:
  - Scale successful campaigns from the **USA** into **Canada** with minimal localization.
  - Replicate best-selling bundles and product recommendations in other promising markets like the **UK** and **Germany**.

- **EMEA shows logistics challenges**:
  - Investigate **shipping partners or local warehousing** in Europe to reduce average delivery times.
  - Explore dynamic shipping options or delivery guarantees to improve customer satisfaction.

---

### Product-specific promotions
- While **Nintendo Switch dominates sales volume**, **gaming monitors generate the highest revenue**.
  - Create **tiered bundles** (e.g., monitor + accessories) to increase average order value.
  - Consider **cross-selling high-margin items** like PlayStation bundles with promotional campaigns despite their lower sales count.

- Reassess product pricing or positioning of low-revenue, high-volume products like the **JBL Quantum 100 Headset** to maximize profitability.

---

### Deep dive into the US market
- With the **US being the top market**, focus on:
  - Retargeting past buyers of gaming monitors and Switch with upgrade offers or related accessories.
  - Analyzing regional US sub-markets to localize promotions more effectively (e.g., West Coast vs. East Coast preferences).
